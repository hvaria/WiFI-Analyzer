# WiFi Analyzer

The **WiFi Analyzer** is a versatile tool designed to monitor WiFi networks and provide insights into network activity. It allows you to:
- Analyze WiFi traffic in real-time, capturing information about devices communicating on the network, including their source/destination addresses and the protocols/ports used.
- Identify vulnerabilities, such as unusually heavy traffic or passwords transmitted in non-encrypted formats.
- View saved WiFi passwords stored on your computer.
- Save captured data to a text file for future analysis.
